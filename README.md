Penguin Species Prediction App

Overview

The Penguin Species Prediction App is a machine learning-based application designed to classify penguins into their respective species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. This is achieved using features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass from the Palmer Penguins dataset. The app serves as an educational tool to demonstrate machine learning concepts and species classification.

Features
	•	User-Friendly Interface: Enter penguin characteristics and predict the species in real-time.
	•	Interactive Visualizations: Display results with informative visuals.
	•	Customizable Models: Easily integrate or update machine learning models.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Python (>= 3.8)
	•	pip (Python package manager)

Setup
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin-species-prediction.git  
cd penguin-species-prediction  


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  


	3.	Run the app:

python app.py  

Usage
	1.	Launch the application using the command above.
	2.	Enter the required features for a penguin:
	•	Bill Length (mm)
	•	Bill Depth (mm)
	•	Flipper Length (mm)
	•	Body Mass (g)
	3.	Click Predict to view the predicted species.
	4.	View the results in the form of clear textual output and visual aids.

Dataset

The app is built using the Palmer Penguins dataset, a well-known dataset in data science for classification tasks. It contains measurements of 344 penguins across three species, along with island location and other metadata.

Dataset details:
	•	Features used:
	•	bill_length_mm
	•	bill_depth_mm
	•	flipper_length_mm
	•	body_mass_g

Model

The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model based on Random Forest Classifier for accurate classification. The model can be retrained or replaced with other algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks, for experimentation.

To retrain the model:
	1.	Modify the train_model.py file to include new parameters or datasets.
	2.	Run the script to save the new model:
